# EU Regulation 261/2004 — Air Passenger Rights

## Overview

EU Regulation 261/2004 (commonly "EU261") establishes common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding, cancellation, or long delay of flights. It applies to:

- All flights departing from an EU/EEA airport (any airline)
- All flights arriving at an EU/EEA airport on an EU/EEA-licensed carrier

## Cancellation Rights

### Notification Timing & Compensation

| Notice Period | Compensation Due? | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| **14+ days before departure** | No | Passenger informed at least 14 days before scheduled departure |
| **7–13 days before departure** | No | If re-routed to depart ≤2h before and arrive ≤4h after original schedule |
| **< 7 days before departure** | No | If re-routed to depart ≤1h before and arrive ≤2h after original schedule |
| **All other cases** | **Yes** | Compensation per distance table below |

### Compensation Amounts

| Flight Distance | Compensation |
|---|---|
| Up to 1,500 km | **€250** |
| 1,500 – 3,500 km (intra-EU: all distances over 1,500 km) | **€400** |
| Over 3,500 km (extra-EU) | **€600** |

**50% reduction** applies if the airline offers re-routing and the arrival time does not exceed the original scheduled arrival by:
- 2 hours for flights ≤ 1,500 km
- 3 hours for flights 1,500–3,500 km
- 4 hours for flights > 3,500 km

### Extraordinary Circumstances

Airlines are **NOT** required to pay compensation if the cancellation is caused by extraordinary circumstances, including:
- Severe weather conditions (storms, volcanic ash, fog)
- Air traffic control restrictions
- Security risks or political instability
- Strikes (external to the airline — e.g., airport staff, ATC)
- Bird strikes

Airlines **ARE** required to pay even in extraordinary circumstances for:
- Technical/mechanical faults (routine maintenance issues)
- Crew scheduling problems (staffing shortages under airline control)
- IT system failures under the airline's control

## Delay Rights

### Short Delays — Right to Care

| Flight Distance | Delay Threshold | Right to Care |
|---|---|---|
| Up to 1,500 km | ≥ 2 hours | Meals, refreshments, 2 phone calls/emails |
| 1,500 – 3,500 km | ≥ 3 hours | Meals, refreshments, 2 phone calls/emails |
| Over 3,500 km | ≥ 4 hours | Meals, refreshments, 2 phone calls/emails |

### Overnight Delays

If departure is delayed until the next day:
- **Hotel accommodation** (including transport to/from hotel)
- **Meals and refreshments** for the duration of the wait

### Long Delays (5+ hours)

If the delay exceeds **5 hours**, the passenger may choose:
- **Full refund** of the ticket (for the part of the journey not made) + return flight to the point of first departure
- **Re-routing** to the final destination at the earliest opportunity
- **Re-routing at a later date** at the passenger's convenience (subject to seat availability)

### Delay Compensation (Sturgeon Ruling)

Per the ECJ Sturgeon ruling (2009), passengers arriving at their final destination with a delay of **3 hours or more** are entitled to the same compensation as for cancellation (€250/€400/€600), unless the delay was caused by extraordinary circumstances.

## Denied Boarding

If a passenger is involuntarily denied boarding (overbooking):
1. The airline must first call for volunteers willing to surrender their reservation in exchange for agreed benefits
2. If insufficient volunteers, the airline may deny boarding involuntarily
3. Involuntarily denied passengers receive:
   - **Immediate compensation** (same amounts as cancellation)
   - **Choice of re-routing or refund**
   - **Right to care** (meals, hotel if overnight)

## Right to Re-routing

When offering re-routing, the airline must provide:
- Transport to final destination **at the earliest opportunity** (on own or other airlines' flights)
- Or re-routing at a **later date at passenger's convenience**
- Comparable transport conditions (same class of service)
- If re-routed to a different airport, the airline pays transfer costs to the original destination airport

## Upgrading and Downgrading

| Situation | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Upgrade** (e.g., Economy to Business) | Airline may NOT charge extra |
| **Downgrade** (e.g., Business to Economy) | Airline must refund: 30% (≤1,500km), 50% (1,500–3,500km), 75% (>3,500km) |

## How to Claim

1. Contact the airline directly (written complaint)
2. If no response within 6 weeks, contact the national enforcement body of the EU country of departure (or arrival, for EU carriers)
3. Time limit for claims: varies by country (typically 2–6 years)

## Key Points for Agents

- **Always inform passengers of their rights** — this is a legal obligation
- Never state that extraordinary circumstances apply without verification from operations
- Compensation is **per passenger, per flight** — families/groups get individual compensation
- Compensation is payable in **cash, bank transfer, or (with written consent) vouchers**
- Passengers are entitled to care (meals, hotel) **regardless** of whether compensation is due
- Right to care applies even in extraordinary circumstances
