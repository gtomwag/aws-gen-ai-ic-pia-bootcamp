# Airline Rebooking & Compensation Policy

## Rebooking Policy

### Tier-Based Rebooking Priority

When a flight disruption occurs, passengers are rebooking in the following priority order:

| Priority | Tier | Service Level |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (Highest) | **Platinum** | Immediate rebooking, dedicated agent line, first-class/business cabin options, complimentary lounge access, hotel voucher (4-star+), $50 meal credit |
| 2 | **Gold** | Priority rebooking within 15 minutes, premium economy/business options, lounge access at hub airports, hotel voucher (3-star+), $30 meal credit |
| 3 | **Silver** | Standard priority rebooking, economy/premium economy options, $15 meal voucher |
| 4 | **General** | Standard rebooking queue, economy options, standard meal voucher if delay >4 hours |

### Rebooking Rules

1. **Same-day rebooking**: Passengers should be offered the earliest available flight to their destination
2. **Next-day rebooking**: If no same-day options exist, the next available flight with hotel accommodation
3. **Alternative airports**: May be offered if significantly earlier arrival; ground transport provided
4. **Partner airlines**: Rebooking on Star Alliance partners permitted for Platinum/Gold members
5. **Class of service**:
   - Passengers must be rebooked in **same or higher** class at no extra charge
   - If only lower class available: rebook + refund the fare difference per EU261 downgrade rules
6. **Multi-modal alternatives**: Rail alternatives (e.g., high-speed rail) may be offered where available and practical

### Connection Protection

- Connections with **less than 45 minutes** between flights are considered at-risk
- At-risk connections should be flagged and alternative routing provided proactively
- If a misconnection occurs due to the disruption, the airline is responsible for the entire re-routing

### Constraints & Preferences

- **Time constraints**: Honor passenger-stated arrival deadlines (e.g., "must arrive before 21:00")
- **Accessibility**: Passengers with reduced mobility (PRM) requirements get priority rebooking with accessible seating
- **Unaccompanied minors (UM)**: Must be rebooked with direct flights only; no self-transfer connections
- **Pet in cabin**: Rebook on flights with pet-in-cabin availability

## Compensation Policy

## Notification Policy

### Proactive Notification Requirements

1. **Timing**: Notify affected passengers within **5 minutes** of disruption confirmation
2. **Channels (in order of preference)**:
   - Push notification (if app installed + consent given)
   - SMS (if mobile number on file)
   - Email (always as fallback)
3. **Content must include**:
   - Flight number and disruption type
   - Reason for disruption (general category — do not disclose internal operational details)
   - Number of rebooking options available
   - Clear CTA: "View Options" or "Speak to Agent"
   - Tier-appropriate greeting and service level indication
4. **Personalization**: Address by name, reference tier status, mention premium perks available
5. **Language**: Send in passenger's preferred language (from booking record)
6. **Follow-up**: If no response within 30 minutes, send reminder via secondary channel

### What NOT to Include in Notifications

- Internal fault codes or blame attribution
- Specific compensation amounts (discuss only when passenger engages)
- Legal jargon or regulation citations (save for agent-assisted interactions)
- Estimated delay times unless confirmed by operations (say "significant delay" vs "2h30m delay" if unconfirmed)
