# Frequently Asked Questions — Flight Disruptions

## For Passengers

### Q: My flight has been cancelled. What are my options?
**A:** You have three choices under EU261:
1. **Re-routing**: We'll find you the next available flight to your destination, at no extra cost
2. **Refund**: Full refund of your ticket for the unused portion of your journey, plus a return flight to your departure city if relevant
3. **Later re-routing**: Travel on a different date of your choosing, subject to seat availability

### Q: Am I entitled to compensation for a cancelled flight?
**A:** It depends on when you were notified and the cause:
- If you were notified **more than 14 days** before departure: no compensation
- If the cancellation was due to **extraordinary circumstances** (severe weather, ATC restrictions, security): no compensation, but you still get right to care (meals, hotel)
- In all other cases: **€250 to €600** depending on flight distance

### Q: How much compensation will I receive?
**A:**
- Flights up to 1,500 km: **€250**
- Flights 1,500–3,500 km (or all intra-EU over 1,500 km): **€400**
- Flights over 3,500 km (non-EU): **€600**
- If the airline offers alternative transport arriving within 2–4 hours of original schedule, compensation may be **reduced by 50%**

### Q: My flight is delayed. What am I entitled to?
**A:** Your entitlements depend on the delay length:
- **2+ hours** (short-haul) / **3+ hours** (medium) / **4+ hours** (long-haul): Meals, refreshments, 2 phone calls/emails
- **Overnight delay**: Hotel accommodation + transport to/from hotel
- **5+ hours**: Option of full refund instead of waiting
- **3+ hours at destination** (Sturgeon ruling): Same compensation as cancellation (€250–€600)

### Q: I'm a Platinum/Gold member. Do I get priority treatment?
**A:** Yes. Premium tier members receive:
- **Priority rebooking** with dedicated agent access
- **Premium cabin availability** (Business/First class if available, at no extra cost)
- **Complimentary lounge access** during the wait
- **Enhanced goodwill compensation** (additional miles, meal credits, hotel vouchers)
- **Proactive notification** — we'll alert you before you need to call us

### Q: Can I be rebooked on a different airline?
**A:** Yes, if we cannot offer a timely option on our own flights. For Platinum and Gold members, rebooking on Star Alliance partner airlines is standard. For Silver and General members, this is evaluated on a case-by-case basis depending on availability and disruption severity.

### Q: I missed my connection because of the delay. What happens?
**A:** If you missed your connecting flight due to a delay on the first flight and both flights were on the same booking:
- We are responsible for re-routing you to your final destination
- You're entitled to meals and refreshments while waiting
- If the next connection requires an overnight stay, hotel accommodation is provided
- Compensation is calculated based on the delay at your **final destination**

### Q: I have special requirements (wheelchair, medical, etc.). How does this affect rebooking?
**A:** Passengers with reduced mobility (PRM) or special medical needs get **priority rebooking** regardless of tier:
- Accessible seating is guaranteed on the new flight
- Direct flights are prioritized (no self-transfer connections)
- If special equipment is needed (wheelchair, oxygen, etc.), we coordinate with the destination airport
- Please inform the agent of any specific requirements during the rebooking process

### Q: I booked through a travel agent / third party. Who handles my rebooking?
**A:** If your flight is disrupted:
- The **airline** handles the immediate rebooking and right to care (meals, hotel)
- For **refunds** of the original ticket, contact your travel agent/booking platform
- For **EU261 compensation**, you can claim directly from the airline regardless of where you booked

### Q: What is a "goodwill gesture" vs "compensation"?
**A:**
- **EU261 compensation** is a legal entitlement — €250/€400/€600 based on distance and delay
- **Goodwill gesture** is an additional offering from the airline — miles, vouchers, meal credits — to acknowledge the inconvenience
- You are entitled to both: the statutory compensation AND any goodwill gesture offered

### Q: How long will it take for my compensation to be processed?
**A:** 
- **Goodwill miles/credits**: Credited to your account within 72 hours
- **EU261 cash compensation**: Processed within 7–14 business days after claim submission
- **Refunds**: 7 business days for credit card refunds per EU261 Article 8

### Q: Can I get my hotel/meal expenses reimbursed?
**A:** Yes, if:
- The delay qualifies for "right to care" under EU261
- You kept your receipts (required for reimbursement)
- Expenses are reasonable (standard restaurant meal, standard hotel — not luxury)
- Submit receipts via the airline's website or customer service within 30 days

## For Agents

### Q: When should I offer EU261 compensation without the passenger asking?
**A:** Always inform passengers of their rights. If the disruption clearly qualifies (e.g., cancellation with <14 days notice, not extraordinary circumstances), proactively mention that compensation may apply and guide them to the claims process.

### Q: Can I override the AI-recommended option?
**A:** Yes. The AI recommendation is a suggestion based on the passenger's tier, preferences, and constraints. Agents have full authority to:
- Present additional options not shown by the AI
- Override the recommended option if the passenger has a preference
- Contact inventory control for manual seat assignments
- Coordinate with partner airlines for cross-booking

### Q: The passenger is upset. What should I do?
**A:** Follow the LARA framework:
1. **Listen** — Let the passenger express their frustration without interruption
2. **Acknowledge** — "I understand this is frustrating, and I'm sorry for the inconvenience"
3. **Resolve** — Focus on finding the best rebooking option
4. **Add value** — Offer appropriate goodwill gesture per tier policy

### Q: What if no rebooking options are available?
**A:** Escalate to your supervisor with the following information:
- Passenger details and tier
- All options searched (own flights, partners, alternative airports)
- Passenger's constraints and preferences
- Recommended resolution (refund, next-day flight, alternative transport)

Supervisors can access additional inventory, coordinate with partner airlines, or approve exceptional compensation.
